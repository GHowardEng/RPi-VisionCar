From: https://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/node/40

0) Make sure you have CMAKE installed

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake

1) Make sure camera is plugged into correct port
2) Turn on camera with sudo raspi-config
3) Copy raspicam-0.1.6 folder to Pi
4) Make raspicam project in a build folder

cd raspicam-0.1.6
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

5) Complete the install 

make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

6) Test by running the test build

Copy to your code folder the header file:
raspicam_cv.h

Add to your compile flags:
-I/usr/local/include/

Add to your link flags:
-lraspicam -lraspicam_cv 

* Note the >> operator was not implemented by the raspicam system, instead use:

cap.grab();
cap.retrieve(frame);
